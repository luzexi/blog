我常常会自己写鸡汤来激励自己，如今想换个方式来做此事，用励志英文来替代。励志英文挺不错的，每次看后都热血澎湃，对生活和工作的理念都非常赞，时常引起我的共鸣，我对每篇文章的体会和重要内容的理解和翻译都会在文章中记录下来，供大家参考和鉴赏。

===

第一段就引起了我的共鸣：在你成功的道路上最大的障碍不是缺少文凭，不是缺少背景，不是缺少金钱，而是缺少你对自己的信心。

		The biggest single obstacle standing in your way to success, it's not lack of education, it's not lack of background, it's not lack of money, it's lack of belief in yourself. 

第三段也能让我感同身受，乐观积极的人与悲观被动的人的差异，在人生的道路上差别巨大：在通向成功的道路上最重要的是你的态度。态度决定你的人生。拥有乐观积极思想的人最终赢得了胜利，充满悲观思想的人最终收获了失败。

		The most important thing to winning is your attitude about you. It's your attitude about life. Positive thinkers win, and negative thinkers lose.

第六段一击即中我心，我们首先应该从精神层面上来赢得世界，才能最终在现实中战胜困难：最重要的是你的激情。你获胜是因为你的心，而不是你的头脑。你获胜是因为你的情感，而不是逻辑。通向胜利的道路上最重要的你有多相信自己。你有多相信自己可以赢得胜利，有多相信许多好事发生在你身上，有多相信你是特别的人。

		The most important thing is your passion. You win with your heart, hot your head. You win on emotion, not on logic. The most important thing to winning is the power of believing in you. The power of believing that you can win. The power of believing that good things will happend to you. The power of believing that you're special.

### 原文如下：

The biggest single obstacle standing in your way to success, it's not lack of education, it's not lack of background, it's not lack of money, it's lack of belief in yourself. I believe the most important thing to winning is you.

I believe the most important thing to winning is you. It's what kind of person you are, what kind of husband you are, what kind of wife you are, what kind of dad you are, what kind of mom you are, what kind of example you are, see folks, you are it. You are everything.

The most important thing to winning is your attitude about you. It's your attitude about life. Positive thinkers win, and negative thinkers lose.

Whatever you expect to happen with confidence happens. The fundamental key to success is what you believe is true for yourself. Not what you want, It's what do you believe.

The first thing you've gotta do to get what you want is believe that you can. Believe it's possible for you to have it. And if there's someone out there that has done it, why the fuck ain't it possible for you? We're all born with the same amount of time in a day, and anything that they can do, you can do too.

The most important thing is your passion. You win with your heart, not your head. You win on emotion, not on logic. The most important thing to winning is the power of believing in you. The power of believing that you can win. The power of believing that good things will happend to you. The power of believing that you're special.

Believe that you can, and once you want something and believe that you can get it, you gotta block out all the noise around you that's gonna tell you you can't do it. Don't listen to all that shit. Just believe that you can.

The difference in being great and average and ordinary, the difference in winning and losing, is this little much. And this much is what I call a special kind of attitude. A special kind of mental toughness. A special kind of hunger to be somebody. 

The single most important thing you'll develop in your entire lifetime is a positive attitude. Focus on how your life will be better, and what your life will look like when you get what you want. You do this, and your brain will think that by helping you get what you want, you're moving away from pain and towards pleasure.

Greatness isn't achieved by that one massive thing you do, it's those tiny little consistent baby steps we take every single day that add up to achieving that goal.

Amazing things happen when you believe you have something. Your brain actively goes out to make it happen. Believe that you can do it, and work hard to get it, and it's yours.

You can do anything you want in this life, anything at all. But you gotta believe it's possible and work your ass off to get it.
