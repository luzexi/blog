#Back to blog

It's a long time before back to blog. Before, I went to Weibo to study something about finance. It's good for in the future. So now I have much knowledge and experience in finance invest. I'm glad that I make the real world more close.

And also, through the finance studying I completely know technology is very more important than i thought before. Technology makes me have good work or job and also good life.

I stay at Weibo for a long time and learn much. But why I'm back, because its too much information in Weibo that will makes me mix and more and more uesless information on Weibo makes me too tired to skip them. So i said to myself that i must think in individual style, only thinking individual style makes me more and more powerful. If I just follow some guy or some information I will be completely failed in my life. The only way to beat otherones else is keep leaning and thinking in individual style.

Now I'm back. It's a completely new start for my technology and my life. I will record all my mind, idea, experience or life in the blog. I wont be shy if my words were error in your view, but I would like to see that you can comment in the end of the page.

'Keep moving, never stop" is my motto.

Thanks for your reading.
