这是一篇鼓励我们朝着梦想前进的文章。

开头中，鼓励我们向更高的成就前进，“If you feel you have something to give, if you feel that your particular talent is worth developing, is worth caring for, then there's nothing you can't achieve.”，如果你感到有什么需要去奉献，或者如果你感觉你的聪明才智值得去开发值得去关注，那么世界上就没有你达不到的成就。

在中间里，鼓励我们超越自己，“When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is that the way it is. Your life is just to live your life inside the world, trying not to bash into the walls too much. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you can life, was make up by people that were no smarter than you. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again. ”，当你长大后，往往会被告知世界就是这样的。你的人生就在这样的世界里，不要试图超越这个范围太厉害。其实这是个非常受束缚的人生。人生可以更加广阔些，一旦你发现一个简单的事实：你周围所有你能生活的，是被那些不比你聪明的人创造出来的。一旦你领悟到这点，你将不再是以前的你了。

最后，鼓励我们创造历史。“Let me share something with you: History is being read, But it is also being written by people with imagination. Dont stop, Dont stop, Dont stop running toward your dream! ”，让我与你分享些事：历史一直在被阅读，但它也一直在被充满想象的人书写。不要停，不要停，不要停止奔向你的梦想。

The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.

I do not belive, that any of us have dreams,
that were not given to us, for the purpose of accomplishing those particular dreams.

If you feel you have something to give, if you feel that your particular talent is worth developing, is worth caring for, then there's nothing you can't achieve.

So applaud you for your dreaming, for your running toward your dream. I applaud you for believing in yourself, because that's what life is about: stretching and challenging, looking for ways that you can begin to improve yourself.

Not only it is possible for you to have your dream, but it's necessary. It's necessary that you go for what is yours in the universe.

Logical, practical thinking says 'you can't do it today'

But if you want to produce unreasonable results in your life, like living your dream and taking charge of your destiny, you've got to be an unreasonable person.

When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is that the way it is. Your life is just to live your life inside the world, trying not to bash into the walls too much. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you can life, was make up by people that were no smarter than you. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again. 

If it's hard, why do people do it? Why did they go? People who climb mountains. Why would Nelson Mandela give up 26 years of his life? Why do people do that? Even though it's hard, it's worth it. It's worth it!

The people who go after their stuff, what makes it worth it? It's gotta be your passion! 

You gotta love it, and it's gotta be what you are supposed to do!You do what it is you supposed to do. You supposed to build something, you supposed to create something. I dont know how to do it. LEARN!

Let me share something with you: History is being read, But it is also being written by people with imagination. Dont stop, Dont stop, Dont stop running toward your dream! 

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
