###### 这是一篇激励自己的文章，情景是当前运动比赛、考试、测试、考验前的心理准备，长久以来的辛苦要在今天得到结果了，赛前的心理暗示对自我充满信心的鼓舞。

文中说，我们已经做好了准备迎接这一刻 “All the training, the hours of preparation, the pain you felt, they have brought you to this moment, they are the armor that you wear.” 所有的训练，所有的准备，所有的忍耐过来的痛苦把我们带到了现在这个时刻，我们已经穿上装甲做好最后的准备。

然后说，质变即将到来 “It's about taking all those hours and turning them into the best version of yourself. Today is about being better than you ever dreamed you could be.” 所有训练和花费的精力都将我们变为更好的自己，我们梦想中能达到的更好的自己将要到来。

接着说，抛开怀疑的态度坚定自己， “Let people doubt you they'll see with time. Let the obstacle stand, you will run right through them. Let everything in this universe tell you no, you have already told yourself yes.” 让怀疑我们的人们看看我们的实力，让障碍停止在那里，我们会垮过去。当整个世界都对你说不行的时候，我们已经知道自己是可以的。

然后说，努力提升自己，"you were the god of your world, And in your world you write the script. There is no tired, you left that in the wait room years ago. There is no one sure, push yourself to exhaustion every day took care of that, There is only when, when do you rise up." 我们是自己世界里的神，可以编写自己的剧本。前几年我们在等候室里不知疲倦。没人会知道我们每天精疲力尽会如何，只有当我们抬升自己时才会感觉到。

最后说，我们总有一天会向世界证明自己，“It will not disappear with time, it will live on, you have earned today. Go make sure the world knows.” 所有的努力都不会消失，它会存留在那里，我们已经赢得了今天，让世界知道我的努力。

### 以下就是全文：

The thing about time is that comes and goes. Tomorrow will make today a distant memory And as quick as you were here, you'll be gone. What's in front of you is an opportunity to make right now something you'll never forget. You have the ability to write history to create a story that will live with you forever.

Think back to all the days leading up to today. All the training, the hours of preparation, the pain you felt, they have brought you to this moment, they are the armor that you wear.

Right now is about execution. It's about taking all those hours and turning them into the best version of yourself. Today is about being better than you ever dreamed you could be. These are the moments you live for.

Gone are the insecurities the doubt the disbelief, this day is yours. Look your opponents in the eye, they cannot give what you can, you have built this opportunity piece by piece, you have created an unstoppable force and it's finally time to reveal that to the world.

Let people doubt you they'll see with time. Let the obstacle stand, you will run right through them. Let everything in this universe tell you no, you have already told yourself yes.

The hardest thing in this world to stop is someone who knows they've won before the game is started. This is your everything, embracing. Make it, so that you never forget today.

you were the god of your world, And in your world you write the script. There is no tired, you left that in the wait room years ago. There is no one sure, push yourself to exhaustion every day took care of that, There is only when, when do you rise up.

There some a point when you just given too much, you sacrifice is too great, to accept anything but the very best, everything else is noise. This is your day.

It will not disappear with time, it will live on, you have earned today. Go make sure the world knows.
