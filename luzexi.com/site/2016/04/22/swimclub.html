These years i work so hard that make my body worse and worse, so i decide to do some excercise to keep health. i think swim is good maybe the one of the best sport for health.</p><p>===</p><p>Actually my first swimming in shanghai make me terrible. I didnot do any excersice for a long time before that, And i event didnot spread myself before jump in the water. I just went in the swimming pool and spend all of energy to swim one side to the other side very fast, therefor i feel lots tried and dizzy. And then you know what, im fucking vomit, damn it.</p><p>Since that i didnt go to swim a long time, maybe 3 month i dont remember. But i still try to do some excersice to keep health. i try to go to gym and buy 5 years membership. i know its waste my money but i bought :( 2 month ago i decide to come back to swim again. This time i try swimming carefully and do spread myself before swim and swim slowly at the beginning. Its feels good, and i think its make me realize that swimming is really good for health and easy to have in my life. So i start to swim every week and recommend others to swim.</p><p>Actually these years i touch many new stuff in my life. i tried understanding foreign culture and learning foreign language and travelling lots of foreign countries and do swimming sport. All these stuffs are out of work, but i think its good for my life. I learn much things which i never touch any or maybe dont like it any. I think its great, i like to challenge.</p><p>Well, i really like swimming but u know sometimes people is just like to do it in a short time, but i think i will insist swimming in a long time, maybe 3 years maybe 10 years. i dont know, i hope i can insist much more times.</p><p>Now i&#39;m going to build a swim club to collect people who love to swim or would like to swim. Its will be much fun if a group people go together and do the same thing. People know that swim is good for their health, but still dont want to play. These&#39;s many reason i heard what they dont want to go. A lot of people dont know how to swim and some of them afraid water, And others maybe too lazy or too busy to do.</p><p>If you would like to swim pls join us. Whatever, i will never give up persuading people to swim. Well i create a swim club in meetup , if you would like to join us ,pls open it and join. http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-Swimming-Meetup/</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2016-04-22T00:00:00+08:00">April 22, 2016</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/life">life</a></span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2016-04-22T00:00:00+08:00">April 22, 2016</time> &middot; <a class="post" href="/tag/life">life</a></span> --></section></main></body></html>
