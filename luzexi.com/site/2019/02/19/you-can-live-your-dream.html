Its hard changing your life.</p><p>===</p><p>That in the process of working on your dreams you are going to incur a lot of disappointment … a lot of failure … a lot of pain … there are moments when you’re going to doubt yourself … and say “ God why? why is this happening to me? I’m just trying to take care of my children and my mother I’m not trying to steal or rob from anybody. How did this have to happen to me ?”</p><p>For those of you that have experienced some hardships, don’t give up on your dream.</p><p>There are rough times that are gonna come but they have not come to stay, they have come to pass.</p><p>Greatness is not this wonderful esoteric, elusive, god like feature that only the special among us will ever taste … it’s something that truly exists in all of us.</p><p>It’s very important for you to believe, that you are the one.</p><p>Most people, they raise a family, they earn a living and then they die.</p><p>They stop growing… they stop working on themselves, they stop stretching, they stop pushing themselves.</p><p>And a lot of people like to complain but they don’t want to do anything about their situation, and most people don’t work on their dreams.</p><p>why? One is because of fear, the fear of failure… “what if things don’t work out?” And the fear of success… “what if they do and I can’t handle it?”. These are not risk takers.</p><p>You spend so much time with other people, you spend so much time trying to get people to like you, you know other people more than you know yourself, you study them… you know about them, you wanna hang out with them, you wanna be just like them.</p><p>And you know what you’ve invested so much time into being like them you don’t know who you are, I challenge you to spend time by yourself.</p><p>It’s necessary that you get the losers out of your life, if you want to live your dream.</p><p>For people who are running towards their dreams, life has a special kind of meaning.</p><p>When you become the right person, what you do is you start separating yourself from other people, you begin to have a certain uniqueness.</p><p>As long as you follow other people and as long as you’re being a copy cat you will never ever be the best copy cat in the world. But you will be the best you can be.</p><p>I challenge you to find your value. That everybody won’t see it, that everybody won’t join you, that everybody won’t have the vision, it’s necessary to know that. That you are an uncommon breed.</p><p>It’s necessary that you align yourself with people and attract people into your business who are hungry.</p><p>People who are unstoppable and unreasonable, people who are refusing to live life just as it is and who want more.</p><p>The people that are living their dream are finding winners to attach themselves to. The people that are living their dreams, are the people that know that if it’s gonna happen it’s up to them.</p><p>If you wanna be more successful, if you wanna do and have stuff that you have never had before, I’m asking you to invest in you.</p><p>Someone’s opinion of you does not have to become your reality … that you don’t have to go through life being a victim. And even if you have to face disappointment, you have to know within yourself, I can do this even if no one else sees this in me I must see it for myself.</p><p>Because you’re still talking about your dream … you’re still talking about your goal …you’ve not done anything … just take the first step … you can touch millions of peoples ‘ lives … and the world will never be the same again … because you came this way.</p><p>Don’t let nobody steal your dreams. If you face a rejection or a no, if you hold a meeting and nobody shows up, if someone says ” you can count on me ” and they don’t come through.</p><p>What if we have that kind of attitude, a cause repossessed, nobody believes in you … you’ve lost again, and again, and again, the lights are cut off … but you’re still looking at your dream, renewing it every day and saying to yourself it’s not over… UNTIL I WIN !</p><p>YOU CAN LIVE YOUR DREAM!</p><h3>Copy from google</h3><span class="meta"><time datetime="2019-02-19T00:00:00+08:00">February 19, 2019</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/life">life</a></span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2019-02-19T00:00:00+08:00">February 19, 2019</time> &middot; <a class="post" href="/tag/life">life</a></span> --></section></main></body></html>
